        <h1>Safety Precautions</h1>
        We are excited to offer the Cape Elizabeth Summer Rec program during these unprecedented 
        times. We will need the cooperation of all parents, campers, and staff in order to provide
        safe and fun activities. Below are the updates, please read the entire document carefully:

        <p style="color: red;">(Updated 6/12/20).</p>

        <button onclick="topFunction()" id="topBtn" title="Go to top">Back to Top</button>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you would like to see the information in the Parent COVID-19 
        Safety Pakcet in PDF form, please <a href="files/parent-covid-info.pdf"

        <ul>
            <li>New location: Adventure Camp (Grades 1-5) and Teen Scene Camp (Grades 6-9) will be
            held at the Middle School/Pond Cove facility. The majority of the day will be outside
            and maps will be sent to all registrants prior to the start of camp.</li>
            <li>Little Cubs Camp will meet at the Cape Care playground (by the High School) and be
            outside for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li>Covid-19 pandemic procedural changes to keep all campers, staff and community safe
            and healthy. There will be a Liability Waiver which must be signed by all parents/guardians
            (provided here).</li>
            <li>It is important to know that we can not guarantee that campers and/or staff will not
            contract Covid-19.</li>
            <li>All camps daily schedules and activities will look and be very different!</li>
        </ul>

        This will not be easy to accomplish at summer camp but we will take every precaution possible.
        It is important to know that we are following the CDC guidelines for summer camps but, again,
        we can NOT guarantee that your camper will not contract Covid-19. <br/>

        We will be implementing all the strategies suggested by the CDC guidelines to the best of our
        ability.

        <ol>
            <li>Implement <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/guidance-for-childcare.html#SocialDistancing" target=_blank>social distancing strategies.</a></li>
            <li>Intensify <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/guidance-for-childcare.html#CleanDisinfect" target=_blank>cleaning and disinfection

        <h2>Precautions and procedures CECS has implemented/will implement to minimize the risk of
        Covid-19 exposure.</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Stay home when appropriate: If you are sick, or have recently had close contact with
            a person with Covid-19.</li>
            <li>Staff and campers should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing 
            Covid-19 symptoms.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>

        <h2>Staggered Parent Drop Off at Camp</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>There will be no bussing to and from camp.</li>
            <li>We will staggering arrival / drop off times and plan to limit direct contact
            with parents as much as possible. We encourage car-line drop-off and pick-up,
            with single family vehicles. We discourage carpooling and parents entering
            the camp area.</li>
            <li>Staggered drop-off times:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Teen Scene -- 8:30 (campers whose last name begins with A thru N) and 8:45
                (campers whose last name begins with O thru Z) at the Staff Parking Lot off of
                Scott Dyer Road near the MS 30s building.</li>
                <li>Adventure Camp Grades 4&5 -- 8:30 am at the Middle School parking lot.</li>
                <li>Adventure Camp Grades 2&3 -- 8:45 am at the Middle School parking lot.</li>
                <li>Adventure Camp Grade 1 -- 9:00 am at the Middle School parking lot.</li>
                <li>Little Cubs (Ages 3-5) -- 8:30 (campers whose last name begins with A thru
                J) and 8:45 (campers whose last name begins with K thru Z) at the Cape Care
                playground by the High School.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>If your camper is registered for all 7 weeks of camp, he or she will remain
            with the same group of campers and staff for all 7 weeks.</li>
            <li>If your family travels outside of Maine during the 7 weeks of summer camp,
            you will need to self quarantine for 14 days, your camper will not be allowed
            back to camp for 14 days.</li>

            <li>We would like 1 parent to drop off/pick up. Ideally, the same parent or designated
            person should drop off and pick up the child every day. If possible, older people such 
            as grandparents or those with serious underlying medical conditions should not pick up 
            children, because they are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</li>

                <li>Each camper will be screened upon arrival*</li>
                <li>Hand sanitizer applied upon arrival.</li>

            diagnosed with, tested for, or quarantined as a result of Covid-19.</li>
            <li>If your camper is at higher risk for complications related to Covid-19.</li>

            especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing,
            or sneezing.</li>
            <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains
            at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until
            they feel dry. We will provide hand sanitizer.</li>

            social distancing is happening. They will be asked to wear a mask when we are forced 
            indoors (rainy days), if they can not social distance, or if they become sick at 
            camp.</li>

        <br/>

        <h2>Cleaning and Disinfecting</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We will <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/clean-disinfect/index.html" target=_blank>clean and disinfect</a> frequently touched surfaces (e.g., playground
            equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) within the camp facility.

            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html" target=_blank>Wash 
            hands</a> after removing gloves.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>

        <h2>What to Bring to Camp</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We discourage sharing of all items, especially those that are difficult to 
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/clean-disinfect/index.html" 
            target=_blank>clean, sanitize, or disinfect</a>. This includes items from home,

            <li>Each camper's belongings will be kept separate from others and each camper will
            have an individual hula hoop, or labeled cubbies.</li>
            <li>We will ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to
            the extent possible (e.g., assign art supplies or other equipment to a single camper),
            or limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of campers at a time and clean
            and disinfect between use.</li>
            <li>We expect all campers and staff to avoid sharing electronic devices, toys, books,
            and other games or learning aids. We will disinfect any devices after each use.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>

        <h2>Water Systems</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>To minimize the risk of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/wmp/index.html" 
            target=_blank>Legionnaires' disease</a> and other diseases associated with

            target=_blank>taking steps</a> to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink
            faucets, & drinking fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown.
            Drinking fountains will be closed, staff and campers need  to bring their own water
            bottles to minimize use and touching of water fountains, we will have water filling
            stations available.</li>
            <li>Pool use for swim lessons and free swim is not available yet. If the pool becomes
            available, there will be no locker rooms available for showering, we will provide
            privacy areas for campers to change.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>

        <h2>Modified Layouts</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>We will space seating/meeting areas at least 6 feet apart.</li>
            <li>Hula hoops will be used for campers to keep their personal items in and sit in
            during meeting time, snack, lunch and certain activities throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If rest times are scheduled (Little Cubs Only), campers' rest time mats will
            be assigned to individual children, <a href="https://nrckids.org/CFOC/Database/3.3" 
            target=_blank>sanitized daily</a> and spaced out as much as possible,
            ideally at least 6 feet apart. Place campers head-to-toe to ensure distance between
            their faces.</li>
            <li>We will prioritize outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained
            as much as possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>

        <h2>Physical Barriers and Guides</h2>

        We will place physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls,
        to ensure that staff and campers remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times.

        <br/><br/>

        <h2>Communal Spaces</h2>

        This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this
        list as we learn more about COVID-19.

        <br/><br/>

        <h2>When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention</h2>

        Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:

        <ul>
            <li>Trouble breathing</li>
            <li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</li>
            <li>New confusion</li>
            <li>Inability to wake or stay awake</li>
            <li>Bluish lips or face</li>
        </ul>

        * This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other
        symptoms that are severe or concerning to you. <br/><br/>

        Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are
        seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19. <br/><br/>

        We will notify all staff and families of camp closures and restrictions in place to limit
        COVID-19 exposure (e.g., limited hours of operation).

        <br/><br/>

        <h2>Things to Remember:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Put distance between yourself and other people.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus.</li>
                <li>Keeping distance from others is especially important for 
                <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html" target=_blank>people who are at higher
                risk of getting very sick</a>. Please let administrative staff know if a camper
                or staff are at higher risk.</li>
                <li>We will impress on all campers that they should not hug, hold hands, or touch
                others.</li>
                <li>During meeting times, arrival, snack, lunch, and dismissal campers will keep
                all of their belongings and themselves in their Hula Hoop. We have purchased hula
                hoops for each child to identify their personal space.</li>
                <li>Each group will not be in or use the same areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Everyone should wear a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target=_blank>cloth face cover</a>, all campers and
            staff will be issued a mask (with their name on it) and they will be expected to wear
            them when they can not be 6 feet away from others during certain activities, and during
            all indoor activities, not all the time.</li>
            <li>The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are 
            infected.</li>
            <li>We will have masks for all children labeled with their name. CECS will
            wash masks daily.</li>
            <li>We will do our best to keep 6 feet between others. The cloth face cover is
            not a substitute for social distancing.</li>
            <li>When feasible, staff members and older children should 
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html" target=_blank>wear face coverings</a> within the 
            facility.</li>
            <li>CECS staff will monitor absenteeism of all campers and staff.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>

        <h2>Staff Will Remind Campers Frequently To:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering,
            remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or
            sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>
            <li>Throw used tissues in the trash.</li>
            <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
            If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand
            sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li>
        </ul>

        <br/>

        <h2>We will require sick children and staff to stay home</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>To parents of campers: We can't stress enough the importance of keeping
            children home when they are sick.</li>
            <li>To staff: The importance of being vigilant for symptoms and staying in
            touch with facility management if or when you start to feel sick, and stay home.</li>
            <li>We have established procedures to ensure children and staff who come to camp
            sick or become sick while at camp are sent home as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>We will keep sick children and staff separate from well children and staff
            until they can be sent home.</li>
            <li>Sick campers and staff members should not return to work until they have met
            the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html"

            target=_blank>disinfect our building or facility</a> if someone is sick.</li>
            <li>If a sick child has been isolated, we will clean and disinfect surfaces in the
            isolation room or area after the sick child has gone home.</li>
